Draw inferences from proofs

Check that there is a clear question and a clear answerâ€”it is all too common to focus on your results and what you have done, instead of stating and then solving a problem. Your results are meaningful only if they solve a meaningful problem. Remember that your paper is neither an account of your work nor a lab diary; it should be a story of an important problem and its solution. Emphasise the problem, both in the Introduction where it should really stand out, and in the Results section and the Discussion. Make it clear to the reader how each result contributes to solving the problem, and what the implications of solving the problem are.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Here is my analysis and proof of it
\item Here's my conclusion(s) about it
\end{enumerate}
