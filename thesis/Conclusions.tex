\chapter{Conclusions} \label{Chapter: Conclusions}

%Introduction and Conclusion shouldn't include anything that it's not in the other parts.
%Objectives should match with conclusions.

%Conclusions mirrors the content of introduction and repeats/summarises the conclusion of the discussions. Nothing new here.

%Check that you end the paper with something worth remembering. This means something concrete. “More research is needed” is a platitude and a vague one at that; better, go for something like “because of the results of this paper, we are now in a position to tackle problem X with method Y, bringing us closer to the ultimate goal of Z”. This is far more concrete and memorable. Endings have power; do not waste this power.

%Future work:
% Train a network with a slightly wider window
% Check contribution of each layer by computing pre-dense saliency maps
% Train network without one-hot amino-acids to prove that they are not that relevant
% Applying DeepLift

%\item Let me summarise my conclusions about it
%\item And let me state the value of them
