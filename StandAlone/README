Hello Friends,
Please follow the following steps to execute the tool:
Description:
This tool is using deep learning network to predict protein secondary structure

How to use:
1. user needs to install Blast+ tool(for executing psiblast: sudo apt-get install ncbi-blast+ ) and Tensorflow/Keras(for loading the deep network pretrained model purpose, that's it; no worry, there is no training involved)

2. the runMUFold_SS tcsh script is a "driver" script that can run through a few steps and make a MUFOLD-SS secondary structure prediction for your sequence. Use vim or any other text editor toopen runMUFOLDSS script file and change following paths to suit your system:
	1) set the Blast data bank location. e.g. 'set dbname = /home/chao/Desktop/UniRef50_Shrinked/uniref50_shrinked.fasta' 
	2) set the NCBI program location. e.g. 'set ncbidir = /home/chao/Desktop/ncbi-blast-2.6.0+/bin'
	3) set the MUFoldSS program installed path. e.g. 'set execdir = /home/chao/Desktop/StandAlone/bin'
	4) set the MUFoldSS data file path. e.g. 'set datadir = /home/chao/Desktop/StandAlone/data'

3. run the script using following command
> cd /home/chao/Desktop/StandAlone/example
> ls
> T0644.fasta
e.g. /home/chao/Desktop/StandAlone/runMUFOLDSS T0644.fasta

4. Predicted Results will be generated the same location where you put your sequence file
e.g.
chao@Alienware-1:~/Desktop/StandAlone/example$ ls
T0644.fasta  T0644.ss

Thank you and enjoy the tool!
